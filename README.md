# NYCH_Price_Prediction-AWS
Price prediction of properties is one of the most important applications in real estate as the housing market goes through a lot of up-and-downs due to volatile economic cycles. A lot of real estate companies depend on the housing market for their bread and butter such as Real Estate Investment Trust. Such businesses also invest in the apartments and houses in New York state and try to regulate their internal pricing models. In New York City, the housing market including the property prices is quite buoyant due to a lot of macroeconomic reasons. However, it is pertinent to note that the inherent characteristics of the house also is a contributing factor to its pricing. Hence, for purchasers and house investors, having knowledge about the driving factors that influence the pricing of a house in the United States is quite helpful in making wise purchasing decisions. The aim of this project is to predict the house listingâ€™s prices in the United States, specifically the state of New York City as that is where housing prices are most volatile. using selected features of the close-by neighborhoods. We will perform regression analysis and optimize our chosen model to the best accuracy with feature selection, model tuning and other techniques. Meanwhile, the resulting model will create potential benefits in multiple areas beyond basic price prediction, such as: 
1) Providing data-proven insights for individual house buyers and sellers; 
2) Enhancing a balanced leverages between the buyers and sellers; 
3) Understanding the real estate market in general for interested stakeholders
